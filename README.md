# uncle-3bdlmola

Your friendly AI usage-reducing helper Chrome extension.

## Overview

Uncle-3bdlmola is a Chrome extension designed to help you reduce your usage of AI chatbots by implementing thoughtful interventions when you visit popular AI websites. In an age where digital dependencies grow stronger by the day, sometimes we need a gentle nudge to reconnect with our unmediated thoughts. This project was created as a learning experience to understand browser API interactions, and as a philosophical exploration of our relationship with artificial intelligence.

## Features

- Provides gentle reminders to limit AI usage, like a digital Socrates questioning your habits
- Lightweight with minimal impact on browser performance.

## TO-DO

- Monitors visits to popular AI chatbot websites
- Customizable intervention settings
- Adjust notification frequency
- Customize reminder messages
- Add or remove monitored websites
- Set daily usage limits (heart game-like attempts — for as in life, some resources should be finite)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saladin0x1/uncle-3bdlmola
cd uncle-3bdlmola
```

2. Install in Chrome:

3. Test the extension by visiting any popular AI chatbot website.

## Configuration

Configuration remains a work in progress, like the eternal journey of self-improvement.

## Development

This project uses standard web technologies:
- JavaScript for extension logic, the language that whispers to machines
- CSS for any UI components, the art that shapes our digital perceptions
- Chrome Extension API for browser integration, the bridge between thought and action

## Project Origins

This project was inspired (not stolen, for ideas belong to the cosmos) by similar work from [FujiwaraChoki](https://github.com/FujiwaraChoki), whose original code was enhanced with additional features and improvements. AI tools were used during development to refine code and improve documentation — a paradoxical collaboration between creator and creation.

## Personal Note

This project was created as a fun exercise to learn browser extension development. The irony of using AI to build a tool that limits AI usage echoes the ancient paradox of using a thorn to remove another thorn. Both are eventually discarded. The main takeaway: just start coding—even small projects can teach valuable skills and help you build momentum. As Laozi might say, "A journey of a thousand lines of code begins with a single character."
